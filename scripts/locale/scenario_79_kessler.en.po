msgid ""
"Save the global satellite network by catching space debris and prevent the "
"Kessler Syndrome! This is a beginner scenario initially created to be played "
"by a crew of school kids. It still assumes general knowledge about operating "
"the stations, so a previous tutorial session or on-site introduction is "
"recommended. The officer(s) on relay&science or on operations should be able "
"to read fluently."

"The Kessler Syndrome is a theoretical Scenario first proposed by NASA "
"Scientist Donald J. Kessler in 1978. It describes the situation where the "
"density of objects in Earth's orbit is high enough to cause a chain reaction "
"of collisions. Each collision will create a huge debris field of multiple "
"objects, and many of them will collide with other objects. Ultimately, the "
"Orbit will be full of tiny objects destroying satellites and making space "
"flight very hard, if not impossible. Also, much of our daily life depends on "
"satellites, like TV, communication, navigation and internet. The Kessler "
"Syndrome would be a serious threat to all of this. This is why clearing "
"space debris, and preventing that kind of scenario is extremely important.\n"

"Greetings!\n"
"We are glad to welcome you aboard our new prototype! If it becomes "
"successful, we might soon start assembling a fleet of tidying ships! "
"Hopefully, they will be able to finally solve the problem of space debris in "
"our orbit!\n"
"This first prototype will only be able to capture larger space junk. We "
"found several suitable candidates for your first test run, they will appear "
"with a four-digit call sign on your radar.\n"
"To capture them, you have to calibrate your shields correctly, so be sure "
"the object will be scanned. A successful scan will reveal the correct "
"capturing frequency. Now, the shields have to be calibrated with the correct "
"frequency. Make sure to activate the shields after calibration. Then you can "
"fly towards the pieces of space junk, and it should successfully be "
"captured.\n"

"Welcome to the new ship. It is smaller and more unsuspicious. On the "
